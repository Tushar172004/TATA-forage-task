# TATA Forage: Sales Data Analysis and Visualization

## üìä Project Overview

This repository contains my solution for the TATA Data Visualisation virtual internship program hosted on Forage. The project's primary objective was to act as a data analytics consultant for a hypothetical online retail store. The store's management (CEO and CMO) wants to understand the major contributing factors to their revenue in 2011 to inform their strategic planning for the next year.

My work focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the provided transactional data to deliver actionable insights that can be used to make informed business decisions.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling raw, unstructured data, removing duplicates, and standardizing values.
* **Data Analysis:** Calculating key business metrics and identifying trends.
* **Advanced Excel:** Using formulas (`SUMIFS`, `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX/MATCH`) and PivotTables to build a robust data model.
* **Data Visualization:** Designing an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to present complex information clearly.
* **Business Storytelling:** Framing data insights to answer specific business questions from the perspective of different stakeholders (CEO and CMO).

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* `README.md`: Project description, goals, and instructions. (This file)
* `TATA_Sales_Analysis_Dashboard.xlsx`: The final project file containing the cleaned data, analysis, and the interactive dashboard.


## üìà Key Insights & Findings

The analysis addresses key questions from both the CEO and CMO:

**For the CEO (Operations Focus):**
* **Revenue Trends Over Time:** The dashboard visualizes monthly revenue to identify seasonal patterns, helping with future forecasting.
* **Geographic Performance:** The analysis highlights top-performing countries and regions (excluding the UK), suggesting potential areas for business expansion.

**For the CMO (Marketing Focus):**
* **Top-Performing Customers:** A key metric is the identification of the highest revenue-generating customers, which can be used for targeted marketing and customer satisfaction initiatives.
* **Product Performance:** Insights into which products and categories contribute most to revenue, helping to optimize marketing campaigns and inventory.
